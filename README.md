# svnproxy: HTTP reverse proxy for subversion

This little project is a fairly standard HTTP reverse proxy. I wrote it because
I was trying to configure `nginx` as a reverse proxy to a Subversion server, and
it was not working. By writing my own simple reverse proxy, I was able to add
debug and any custom features I needed.
